Customer Churn Prediction Using SMOTE ( Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique )
The objective of our research is to investigate machine learning techniques, propose a model for anticipating customer churn, identify churning factors, and provide retention strategies.
Using diverse machine learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression.
The application of SMOTE allows for more accurate predictions and helps in reducing the impact of class imbalance on the model's performance.
